# whispertranscribe

An R-based tool that uses Open-AIs `whisper` to create transcripts from audio.

## Shiny app and R-file

There are two ways how to use `WhisperTranscribe`. Please see the requirements
first, before running the applications.

### 1. Shiny Application
There is a shiny application in the `WhisperTranscribe` sub-folder. The app is 
located in the single `app.R` file. By running this file the shiny app should 
load.


### 2. R-File
The file `transcribe.R` converts all file with the provided extension in the
input folder into transcripts in the output folder.


## Requirements

WhisperTranscribe needs Python + the Open-AI library. The setup file should 
install both of these.
If you don't want to use the sandbox environment of reticulate you can install 
the required library using pip as follows:

```
pip install -U openai-whisper
```

### Troubleshooting
See here https://github.com/openai/whisper for extended troubleshooting.

Whisper needs `ffmpeg` to understand different audio formats.
